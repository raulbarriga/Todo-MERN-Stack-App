## Set up an .env file with a MongoDB URI (at [MongoDB](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login)).

# You'll need to set up your own .env file on the server folder that'll contain the MONGO_URI that is imported in the main server.js file. The MONGO_URI variable in the .env file will look like this: `MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<your_name>:<password>@<project_name>.xxxx.mongodb.net/<database_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority`.
# You'll have to set up your own project there.

## Install needed packages

# For the client side, run `npm install` to get all the packages downloaded.
# On another terminal window for the server folder, also run `npm install` for those packages.
# Then for both the client and the server's terminal windows, run `npm start` to start them off.

Now you'll see the project open up in your browser.
